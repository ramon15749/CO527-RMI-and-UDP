1. A short summary (no more than 1 page) describing your findings from running the programs. You
should address the following points:
(a) For each mechanism, what are possible causes, if any, of messages being lost?
(b) Are there any patterns in the way messages are lost?
(c) What is the relative reliability of the different communication mechanisms?
(d) Which was easier to program and why?
2. Proof that the both RMI and UDP programs actually ran, e.g. console logs or screen dump plus an
indication of which message numbers, if any, were lost.
3. A well formatted listing of the completed code for the 4 classes (2 client server pairs) which is easy
to read. Start each of the 4 classes on a new page and avoid very long lines (i.e. <70 characters).

Your solutions should deal with exceptions appropriately.

Please provide program listings in the following order:
1. RMI Client
2. RMI Server
3. UDP Client
4. UDP Server
